# AutoPy
Automation script that runs through the processing of laser scans in Faro Scene and drone images in Pix4D. IMPORTANT: This scrips will only work here at this location. If downloaded it will not work due to how file locations are set up and which versions of the programs are used.

AutoPy-Image is a preview of the GUI to input jobs into.

The other part of the program is the main part that will automatically process through the programs. It can be running on a computer and whenever the GUI adds a job to the list, it will run it.
